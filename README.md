# Fake News Detection on Twitter

This project explores the task of detecting fake news on Twitter using both textual features (tweet content) and simple, publicly accessible user-level metadata. Our approach is focused on transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability â€” avoiding complex network-based models or inaccessible features.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Detect fake tweets using lightweight, explainable models.
- Compare performance between textual, non-textual, and combined features.
- Evaluate models on key metrics (F1, AUC, accuracy, etc.).
- Use SHAP and LIME for model explainability.
